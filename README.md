## Introduction

This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures. This repo is not complete and I am adding more algorithms and data structures whenever I can.

Inside of each section, you will find a `README.md` file in the root of the subfolder, a `challenge` folder, a `solutions` folder, and a `testing` folder.

The tests are done currently through node.js through the command line.

The `README` for each section contains visual and meaningful explanations of the algorithm or data structure.

This repo is incomplete and is subject to major breaking changes.

If you see any errors please open an issue or make a pull request.

Kindest,
~Hope
