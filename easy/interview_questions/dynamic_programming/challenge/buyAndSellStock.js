// Given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Maximum profit can be achieved by buying on one day and selling on another day. Return the maximum profit.

//   Example 1:

// Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

//   Example 2:

// Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

function buyAndSellStock(prices) {
  // do something
}
