# Visual and meaningful explanations of sorting algorithms

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. Its name comes from the way it continually selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it to its final position in the sorted part of the list.

Imagine you're at a book fair with books of different sizes, and you've been tasked with arranging all the books on a shelf in increasing order of size.

Here is a step-by-step description of how you'd use the Selection Sort approach to do that:

1. **Searching for the smallest book:** You start at one end of the table where all the books are laid out randomly, you take a stroll along the table, looking at each book to find the smallest one. You compare each book's size with the smallest one you've found so far. After a full stroll, you've now identified the smallest book.

2. **Swapping the smallest book:** You now swap this smallest book with the one at the very leftmost unsorted position on your shelf. If you're just starting, this would be the first position on the shelf. After the swap, this book is now in its final, sorted position, and you won't need to move it again.

3. Repeat: You now consider the rest of the books on the table, ignoring the one you've just placed on the shelf. You repeat the process: find the smallest book, and swap it with the first one in the unsorted section of your shelf.

4. **Iterating:** You continue doing this, and with each iteration, one more book is moved from the table (unsorted) to its correct position on the shelf (sorted). As you keep going, the section of unsorted books on your shelf gets smaller.

5. **Finalizing:** Eventually, you will be left with just one book on the table, which is the largest one. You place this last book at the end of the shelf.

After these steps, all the books are sorted in increasing order of size on your shelf. That's the essence of the Selection Sort algorithm.

Note that Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient on large lists, and it performs worse than the similar Insertion Sort. However, it has the property of minimizing the number of swaps, in case this operation is costly.

Here's a visualization of the Selection Sort algorithm in action:

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is another comparison-based sorting algorithm, and its name comes from the way smaller (or larger, depending on the sorting order) elements "bubble" to their correct positions.

Let's imagine a different scenario to illustrate Bubble Sort: You're a teacher with a row of students lined up for a group photo, and you want to arrange them in ascending order of their heights.

Here is a step-by-step description of how you'd use the Bubble Sort approach:

1. **Compare Adjacent Students:** You start at one end of the line and compare the heights of the first two students. If they are in the correct order (the shorter student is on the left), you leave them as they are. If they are in the wrong order (the taller student is on the left), you swap their positions.

2. **Move to the Next Pair:** You then move one position to the right and compare the heights of the next pair of students. Again, you swap them if they are in the wrong order.

3. **Continue to the End:** You continue this process, moving from left to right, comparing each pair of students and swapping them if necessary. By the time you reach the end of the line, the tallest student will have "bubbled" up to their correct position at the rightmost end of the line.

4. **Repeat:** You then return to the start of the line and repeat the process. This time, the second-tallest student will "bubble" up to their correct position.

5. **Iterating:** You keep repeating this process. After each pass, the next tallest student will have moved to their correct position. It's like a series of waves gradually moving students to the right until they reach their correct positions.

6. **Finalizing:** You stop repeating this process when you make a complete pass along the line without needing to swap any students. This means that every student is shorter than (or the same height as) the student on their right, which means the students are now in order.

That's the essence of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Bear in mind that like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort also has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not suitable for large lists. There are more efficient algorithms for larger lists, such as QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort. However, Bubble Sort is straightforward to understand and implement, which makes it a useful educational tool for teaching the concept of sorting algorithms.

## Insertion Sort

The insertion sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It's much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or mergesort, but it has its uses in particular contexts.

Let's think about playing a game of cards for this one.

1. **Picking up the first card:** Suppose you're playing a card game where you need to sort your hand into increasing order. Initially, you pick up one card at a time from the table.

2. **Picking up the next card:** Then you pick up a second card. If it's smaller than your first card, you put it to the left of your first card. If it's larger, you place it to the right. Now, your first two cards are sorted relative to each other.

3. **Inserting the third card:** Next, you pick up a third card from the table. If it's larger than your last card, you put it to the right of your hand. If it's smaller than your first card, you put it to the left. If it's in between, you "insert" it between the first two cards. Now, your first three cards are sorted.

4. **Continuing the process:** You keep doing this for all the remaining cards on the table. For each new card, you look at your hand, find the right place for the card, and insert it there. Each time, you're maintaining the property that the cards in your hand are sorted.

5. **Finalizing the hand:** After you've picked up all the cards from the table, the cards in your hand are sorted in increasing order. You've now completed the game.

This process, which you've just followed, is essentially the Insertion Sort algorithm. In computational terms, the "cards in your hand" can be thought of as a sorted subarray of the array you're sorting. At each step, you extend the sorted subarray by one element, by inserting the next element into its correct position within the subarray. This analogy illustrates the simplicity and intuitive nature of the insertion sort algorithm, but also hints at its inefficiency. Finding the correct position for a card can, in the worst case, require scanning the entire hand so far, which is why insertion sort is less suitable for large, unsorted datasets. However, it performs well on small datasets or on lists that are already partially sorted.
