## Pascals Triangle

Pascals Triangle

Let's use the analogy of a "Raindrop Pyramid" to illustrate how Pascal's Triangle works.
Imagine a pyramid made of small containers or cups. At the top, there is a single cup that can hold one raindrop. Below that, there are more rows of cups, each containing one more cup than the row above, forming a triangular shape. Rain is falling precisely on the top cup, and when a cup overflows, it distributes its excess equally to the two cups positioned directly beneath it.

1. Single drop at the top: Our pyramid starts with a single cup at the top that catches one raindrop.

  ```css
         [1]
  ```

2. Row of two cups: When the top cup overflows, it distributes its overflow evenly to the two cups in the row beneath it. Now we have a second row with each cup holding one drop.

  ```css
         [1]
       [1] [1]
  ```

3. Row of three cups: The two cups in the second row are now full, and when they overflow, each distributes its excess equally to the two cups underneath it. Notice how the middle cup in the third row is under the path of two cups, so it collects an overflow drop from each of them, and ends up with two drops.

  ```css
         [1]
       [1] [1]
     [1] [2] [1]
  ```

4. Continuing the pattern: This pattern continues for each new row. Each cup catches an overflow drop from each of the two cups in the row above that are closest to it. The cups on the edges only have one cup above them, so they always end up with one drop.

  ```css
         [1]
       [1] [1]
     [1] [2] [1]
   [1] [3] [3] [1]
  ```

5. Continuing indefinitely: This pattern will continue indefinitely, creating more and more rows of cups. Each row represents another "row" of Pascal's Triangle, with the number in each "cup" corresponding to the number in each position in the triangle.

And there you have it! The "Raindrop Pyramid" analogy shows how Pascal's Triangle algorithm works. The raindrops represent the numbers in the triangle, with each number being the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

In a computational sense, to generate Pascal's Triangle, we initialize the triangle with a row of a single 1. Then for each subsequent row, we calculate each new value as the sum of the two values above it (with 'missing' values treated as 0). This continues for as many rows as we want to generate.


## Two Sum

The Two Sum problem is a common coding problem where you are given an array of numbers and a target number. You need to find the two numbers in the array that add up to the target number. The output is usually the indices of these two numbers.

Here's a straightforward analogy:

Imagine you're a detective named Sherlock at a party, and you've been given a challenge. There are guests at the party, and every guest has a number tag. Your task is to find two guests whose number tags add up to a specific target number.

Here's how you could use the Two Sum algorithm to solve this problem:

1. Remember the guests you've met: As you mingle and meet each guest, you remember the number tag they're wearing. You can think of this as "iterating through the array".

2. Look for the complement: For each guest you meet, you also consider whether there's a guest you've met before whose number tag, when added to this guest's number tag, equals the target number. In other words, you're looking for a guest whose number tag is the "complement" of the current guest's number tag with respect to the target.

3. Use your 'guestbook' for quick lookup: To avoid having to remember and scan through all the previous guests every time, you maintain a 'guestbook' where you jot down the number tags of all the guests you've met. This way, you can quickly check whether a complement exists in the 'guestbook'.

4. Find the pair: As soon as you meet a guest whose complement you've already met (i.e., is in the 'guestbook'), you've solved the puzzle! You've found two guests whose number tags add up to the target number.

In algorithmic terms, you're given an array of numbers and a target number. You create an empty hash map (the 'guestbook'). Then you iterate through the array, and for each number, you check whether its complement (target minus this number) is in the hash map. If it is, you've found a pair of numbers that add up to the target. If it isn't, you add the current number to the hash map and move on to the next number.

This solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the array and lookup in a hash map takes constant time on average. So, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array.

So there you have it, Sherlock! With this approach, you can solve the challenge quickly and enjoy the rest of the party.
